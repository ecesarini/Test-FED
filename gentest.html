            Here is the code for the client side of the application:
            from socket import *
            serverName = ’hostname’
            serverPort = 12000
            clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
            message = raw_input(’Input lowercase sentence:’)
            clientSocket.sendto(message.encode(),(serverName, serverPort))
            modifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)
            print(modifiedMessage.decode())
            clientSocket.close()
            Now let’s take a look at the various lines of code in UDPClient.py.
            from socket import *
            The socket module forms the basis of all network communications in Python. By
            including this line, we will be able to create sockets within our program.
            serverName = ’hostname’
            serverPort = 12000
            The first line sets the variable serverName to the string ‘hostname’. Here, we provide a string containing either the IP address of the server (e.g., “128.138.32.126”)
            or the hostname of the server (e.g., “cis.poly.edu”). If we use the hostname, then a
            DNS lookup will automatically be performed to get the IP address.) The second line
            sets the integer variable serverPort to 12000.
            clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
            This line creates the client’s socket, called clientSocket. The first parameter indicates the address family; in particular, AF_INET indicates that the
            underlying network is using IPv4. (Do not worry about this now—we will discuss IPv4 in Chapter 4.) The second parameter indicates that the socket is of
            type SOCK_DGRAM, which means it is a UDP socket (rather than a TCP socket).
            Note that we are not specifying the port number of the client socket when we
            create it; we are instead letting the operating system do this for us. Now that the
            client process’s door has been created, we will want to create a message to send
            through the door.
            message = raw_input(’Input lowercase sentence:’)
            raw_input() is a built-in function in Python. When this command is executed,
            the user at the client is prompted with the words “Input lowercase sentence:” The
            user then uses her keyboard to input a line, which is put into the variable message.
            Now that we have a socket and a message, we will want to send the message through
            the socket to the destination host.
            clientSocket.sendto(message.encode(),(serverName, serverPort))
            In the above line, we first convert the message from string type to byte type, as we
            need to send bytes into a socket; this is done with the encode() method. The
            method sendto() attaches the destination address (serverName, serverPort)
            to the message and sends the resulting packet into the process’s socket,
            clientSocket. (As mentioned earlier, the source address is also attached to
            the packet, although this is done automatically rather than explicitly by the code.)
            Sending a client-to-server message via a UDP socket is that simple! After sending
            the packet, the client waits to receive data from the server.
            modifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)
            With the above line, when a packet arrives from the Internet at the client’s socket, the
            packet’s data is put into the variable modifiedMessage and the packet’s source
            address is put into the variable serverAddress. The variable serverAddress
            contains both the server’s IP address and the server’s port number. The program
            UDPClient doesn’t actually need this server address information, since it already
            knows the server address from the outset; but this line of Python provides the server
            address nevertheless. The method recvfrom also takes the buffer size 2048 as
            input. (This buffer size works for most purposes.)
